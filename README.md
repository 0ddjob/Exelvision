# Exelvision EXL100
 Exelvision hardware projects.
## [EXLROM - Multi-ROM cartridge](/EXLROM/)
The EXL100 could accept ROM cartridges from 8KByte to 32KByte in size, including BASIC.  By using a 4Mbit ROM (27C040) we can fit all known ROMs onto one cartridge.  How exciting.<br>
I've designed two versions: a simple 256kbit version that will hold a single 32KByte ROM (like the olden days) and the 4Mbit version that will hold up to 16 32KByte ROMs.<br>
